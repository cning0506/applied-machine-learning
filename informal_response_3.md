# Informal Response 3 (2/18/2021)

[Back to Home Page](https://jeremy-swack.github.io/applied-machine-learning/)

## Three Chosen Filters:

```
filter = [ [1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
```

This first filter results in this image:

![image_1](inf_resp_3_img_1.png)

This filter appears to make the image slightly more blurry.

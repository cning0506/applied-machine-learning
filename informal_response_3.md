## The Original Image

![image_org](inf_resp_3_orig.png)

## Three Chosen Filters:

```
filter = [ [1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
```

This first filter results in this image:

![image_1](inf_resp_3_img_1.png)

This filter appears to make the image slightly more blurry.

```
filter = [ [0, -1, 0], [-1, 4, -1], [0, -1, 0]]
```

![image_2](inf_resp_3_img_2.png)

This filter appears to accentuate the diagonal lines found in the top left of the picture.
